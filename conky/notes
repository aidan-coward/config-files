conky 1.10 and onwards use new lua-based syntax:
instructions for switching(all done afaik as of july 1)
i think it is broken since it displays things that are supposed to be comments

wrap your config section in
conky.config = { ... }

wrap your TEXT section in
conky.text = [[ ... ]]

the config options are lookup values and you need to assign the values (i.e. use "=")

each line in the config section ends with ","

replace "yes" and "no" with "true" and "false", resp. (without quotes)

all values except numbers, "true" and "false" need quotes

comments are marked with "--" instead of "#"
