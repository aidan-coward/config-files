2018-05-25 16:25:10	irreleph4nt	coderobe, said big project has precompiled .deb and .rpm packages for other distros ... in fact, multiple packages all based on the code in said big project

2018-05-25 16:25:40	coderobe	right, that's irrelevant when the source exists though
2018-05-25 16:25:55	irreleph4nt	coderobe, so to make sure it works on Arch the same way it does on other distros, I want makepkg to spit out all these packages as well
2018-05-25 16:26:03	coderobe	no, you don't
2018-05-25 16:26:04	beest	don't you mean ... yeah.

2018-05-26 07:42:07	Gnea	I'm having problems getting Xorg to work. Using an Nvidia 8400GS with the 340.xxx dkms driver. Xorg log complains about the ABI version 24 not lining up. Found this: https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/58660 but IgnoreABI causes my system to hardlock, so I disabled it. Should I consider downgrading Xorg to 1.19?

2018-05-26 08:14:16	Zaplo	I installed custom kernel and mkinitcpio is now complaining about missing nvidia modules. I then installed nvidia-dkms and it installed nvidia dkms module to my custom kernel without errors. Do i need to do something to enable it, or should the driver load on boot automatically?
2018-05-26 08:14:44	Namarrgon	it will load on boot automatically, unless you did something funny
2018-05-26 08:14:48	jadesoturi	true. but ive had this cam for a few years.. and i remember it had 30fps at some point in linux as well. but i cant remember what driver what used then :(
2018-05-26 08:15:29	Zaplo	Namarrgon, in that case i'll try it.. and hopefully be back in 5 minutes

2018-05-26 08:20:47	Gucci_Bandana	I solved my issue. Googling is always the thing I should do first.
2018-05-26 08:20:49	Namarrgon	jadesoturi: does qv4l2 list the resolution you want?
2018-05-26 08:20:55	irreleph4nt	One question I have would be: Does ${pkgdir} refer to the same directory for all of them or does makepkg create a separate directory for all of them?

2018-05-26 09:07:44	Namarrgon	gnome got rid of the "desktop", it's a feature
2018-05-26 09:07:54	ayekat	merzo: do you mean the functionality of the screen space that is not covered by windows, where usually there are icons and things happen when you right-click on it?
2018-05-26 09:08:03	ayekat	merzo: or merely the ~/Desktop directory?
2018-05-26 09:08:09	coderobe	!errors
2018-05-26 09:08:11	phrik	Don't just say it doesn't work. Give the exact error. If there is more information than a line or two, see !paste

2018-05-26 09:09:31	merzo	ayekat "functionality of the screen space that is not covered by windows, where usually there are icons and things happen when you right-click on it?"
2018-05-26 09:09:35	ayekat	ah
2018-05-26 09:10:23	ayekat	so there are no icons, and nothing happens when you right-click on it? (I assume something should happen if it's managed by nautilus, but I have no idea)
2018-05-26 09:11:03	merzo	no icons just a white screen
