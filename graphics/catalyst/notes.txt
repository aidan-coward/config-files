rebooted to apply all changes

did not change screen resolution like normal

when starting X got error: atiddxprobe fail to probe intel vga device

bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=165654 says that for hybrid graphics you need to enable kms so removed 'nomodeset' from GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT in /etc/default/grub

rebooted

screen changed resolution like normal

another arch thread id=145358 says that removing the BusID parameter from xorg.conf might work so commented that out

rebooted

x did not start 

commented out device section(lines 25-29)

xorg started

glxinfo fails with "Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0"" and a segfault

playonlinux gave error 'playonlinux is unable to find 32bits opengl libraries'

catalyst aw page suggests to add agp module on line before fglrx in file /etc/modules-road.d/fglrx.conf 
find this by running 'hwdetect --show-agp' , gives result of module intel-gtt

rebooted

did not change anything

last post on page https://www.playonlinux.com/en/topic-11861.html indicates that the driver does not put the opengl libraries where playonlinux wants to look for them

added to existing module section(line 14) in /etc/X11/xorg.conf
Section "Module"
	Load "glx"
EndSection

rebooted

didn't do anything

tried to start league, client opened but actual game crashed with same 'xlib glx missing' error as before

removed package xf86-video-intel

rebooted

x would not start so reinstalled xf86-video-intel

removed lib32-glibc.conf from /etc/ld.so.conf.d/

ran ldconfig

didn't change

added line /usr/lib/fglrx to created file /etc/ld.so.conf.d/local.conf
this was to redirect to look for libgl

ran ldconfig again

still gives glx missing error

installed lib32-mesa-demos

added /usr/lib32/fglrx to file /etc/ld.so.conf.d/local.conf

ran ldconfig

rebooted

error persists

added /usr/lib64/fglrx to file /etc/ld.so.conf.d/local.conf

removed all instances of fglrx from /etc/ld.so.conf.d/local.conf

error persists

removed /usr/lib/libGL.so.1 and /usr/lib/libGL.so.1.2

uninstalled catalyst-total

added catalyst repository to /etc/pacman.conf

installed packages:

catalyst-hook
catalyst-utils
catalyst-libgl
opencl-catalyst - optional, needed for OpenCL support
lib32-catalyst-utils - optional, needed for 32-bit OpenGL support on 64-bit systems
lib32-catalyst-libgl - optional, needed for 32-bit OpenGL support on 64-bit systems
lib32-opencl-catalyst - optional, needed for 32-bit OpenCL support on 64-bit systems

glx error is still there

added acpi_backlight=vendor to line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX in file /etc/default/grub and ran grub-mkconfig

built/installed catalyst-total, removed aforementioned catalyst packages

when 'grep EE /var/log/Xorg.log' 
atiddxProbe: fail to probe intel VGA device
is this the problem?

http://askubuntu.com/questions/341730/ubuntu-on-hp-pavilion-g7-1153er-with-hybrid-radeon-6470m-and-intel-3000
says that adding acpi_backlight=vendor to kernel line in grub should fix it

rebooted

didn't fix it

added intel-agp to first line on /etc/modules-load.d/fglrx.conf

downgraded xorg to 1.16

rebuilt catalyst




trying again

added nomodeset to kernel line - this tells the machine to use bios modes until X is loaded - hence why the resolution does not change as it does with radeon

arch forum topic 202431 says that dual card machines require radeon to work - maybe it's the blacklisting of radeon that is causing the problem

removed blacklist radeon from /etc/modprobe.d/modprobe.conf
