added new xorg file 10-gpu.conf

added radeon.conf to /etc/modules-load.d/

added radeon module to the MODULES line in /etc/mkinitcpio.conf
regenerated initramfs with 
# mkinitcpio -p linux

the three preceding steps did not fix the problem of "drm report modesetting isn't supported"
this error is caused because the radeon module is not loaded

when the radeon module is loaded, x fails to start and grep EE displays "screens:0"
